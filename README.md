This document describes the structure and use of the CAmkES debug tool, which
allows you to debug systems built on the CAmkES platform. The documentation is
divided into sections for users and developers. The [Usage](#usage) section
is for people wanting to debug a component that they or someone else has built
on CAmkES, as well as the current limitations of the tool. The 
[Developers](#developers) will describe the internal implementation of the tool,
for anyone who wishes to modify or extend the functionality of the tool itself.
This document assumes some familiary with [CAmkES](https://github.com/seL4/
camkes-tool/blob/master/docs/index.md) and the [seL4 microkernel](http://sel4.systems/). 
If you are not familiar with them then you should read their documentation first.
